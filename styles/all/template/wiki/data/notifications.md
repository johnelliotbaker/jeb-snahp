**Extra information:**

_Receive reputation notifications_

When turned completely off, you might still get some reputation notifications. This is due to the server setup. These notifications for all users are stacked together and "given out" a few at a time to reduce the server load.

To delete the remaining notifications follow these steps:

- Go to your **[<i class="icon fa-sliders fa-fw" aria-hidden="true"></i> User Control Panel](https://forum.snahp.it/ucp.php)**.
- The page is opened in the tab Overview. Go to the **Snahp** tab and click on **Visibility** to see all the options. _See image 1_
- At the bottom you can find the option **Delete All Reputation Notifications**. _See image 2_
