Quick Search Upgrade
===

What's this?
---
Every user group has a set amount of delay between consecutive searches.
Each instance of Quick Search Upgrade will decrease this search interval
by a constant amount (typically 1 second per upgrade). Depending on the
future circumstances, the moderators may adjust this amount as necessary.


What are the rules?
---
Although there are no rules per se, there is a caveat.  
No matter how many upgrades you purchase, there will be a minimum delay of
5 seconds per user. Therefore, each user sould take care not to purchase
more upgrades than necessary. If your group has a starting search interval of 20 seconds,
you should only purchase a maximum of 15 Quick Search Upgrades.


Are there any limitations?
---
You can only reduce the search interval to a minimum of 5 seconds.

Will the upgrades expire?
---
Most upgrades will have a life span between 6 to 12 months.

Disclaimer
---
The moderation staff holds the right to adjust or disable any user upgrade.
