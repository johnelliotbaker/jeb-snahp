      digg subscription system
    </h1>

    <h2> What is digg? </h2>
    <p>
      When a user makes a new topic in the listings forum,
      she will be given an option to register that topic for a digg subscription service.
      Once registered, any user on the forum will then be able digg (or subscribe to) that topic.
      A subscribed user will get a notification when the topic poster broadcasts an update.
    </p>

    <h2>What kind of topics should I register for digg?</h2>
    <p>
      Any kind of topics with ongoing updates will qualify.
      Large collections such as anime megapacks, movie collections and ebooks library,
      or periodically televised contents are all good topics to register for digg.
    </p>

    <h2>I made a new topic. How do I register my thread for digg?</h2>
    <p>
      On the top right side of your topic, you should see a <span class="digg_backdrop"><i class="fa fa-digg register" aria-hidden="true"></i></span> symbol.
      Click on it to register your topic for digg.
    </p>

    <h2>I just made my topic diggable and now I am ready to update my users. How do I send out update notifications?</h2>
    <p>
      Once you register your topic for digg, the <i class="fa fa-digg register" aria-hidden="true"></i> symbol should automatically change to <i class="fa fa-wifi" aria-hidden="true"></i> symbol.
      Click on <i class="fa fa-wifi" aria-hidden="true"></i> to broadcast your topic to your subscribers.
    </p>

    <h2>How often can I broadcast my updates?</h2>
    <p>
      Currently, we allow topic posters to update their post once every 12 hours.
      The cooldown is enforced on per topic basis.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I digg a topic?</h2>
    <p>
      You can only subscribe to a digg if the topic poster has registered it for subscription.
      Once registered 
      <i class="fa fa-digg" aria-hidden="true"></i> symbol
      should appear on the top right corner of that topic.
      Click on it to start diggin' it!
    </p>

    <h2>
      Why aren't all topics registered for digg subscription automatically?
    </h2>
    <p>
      Any new feature brings with it a small but incremental cost to the forum performance.
      If we registered all topics for digg, we could add significant burden to our server.
      Since not every topic is expected to have an ongoing updates,
      the topic poster is given the discretion
      to register her topics based on proper circumstances.
