digg subscription system
===

What is digg?
---
When a user makes a new topic in the listings forum,
she will be given an option to register that topic for a digg subscription service.
Once registered, any user on the forum will then be able digg (or subscribe to) that topic.
A subscribed user will get a notification when the topic poster broadcasts an update.

What kind of topics should I register for digg?

Any kind of topics with ongoing updates will qualify.
Large collections such as anime megapacks, movie collections and ebooks library,
or periodically televised contents are all good topics to register for digg.

Why aren't all topics registered for digg subscription automatically?
---
Any new feature brings with it a small but incremental cost to the forum performance.
If we registered all topics for digg, we could add significant burden to our server.
Since not every topic is expected to have an ongoing updates,
the topic poster is given the discretion
to register her topics based on proper circumstances.
